# Blogging-Website
It is a blogging website named BlogFlow created with HTML, CSS and Javascript and this website is responsive.

In the index.html file, I made the cover page of my blogging website and in which it contains the following key elements.(index.css is stylesheet for this file)
1) Navigation bar: It contains links of Home, About Us, Write a Blog and Login pages.As I haven't learnt backend yet, I gave the same home page address address for login button and I'll 
                   update it later.
2) Design of the cover page with phone.png image.
3) Start reading button.(This is a button contains link of the home page.)
4) An image for the curvy design of the cover page.
